# Tasks-Importance
The task importance aspect reflects the level of attention that should be paid to certain task elements. We differentiate between the following levels of attention: standard (meaning common daily work), elevated (task performer should be cautious with certain task elements), and high (the process worker should be especially cautious with certain task elements). For extraction purpose, we propose a specific approach of Business Sentiment (BS). BS represents an emotional component of a task and its contextual importance perceived by a task performer. This latent information is extracted from task textual description with a BS lexicon and formalized using the mentioned qualitative scale of standard, elevated, and high.
